## üî¨ Detection Methods Explained

### 1. Stylometric Analysis üìà
**What it does:** Analyzes writing style characteristics to identify patterns typical of human vs AI writing.

**Key Features Analyzed:**
- **Vocabulary Richness** - Measures word diversity and complexity
- **Sentence Length Distribution** - Analyzes sentence structure patterns
- **Word Frequency Analysis** - Identifies repetitive patterns
- **Punctuation Usage** - Examines punctuation patterns and frequency
- **Capitalization Patterns** - Analyzes capitalization frequency
- **Word Length Variance** - Measures variation in word lengths
- **Common Words Ratio** - Identifies overused vocabulary
- **Unique Word Ratio** - Measures vocabulary diversity
- **Sentence Length Variance** - Analyzes sentence structure variation

**How it works:**
```python
# Example: Analyzing sentence length variance
sentence_lengths = [len(nltk.word_tokenize(s)) for s in sentences]
sentence_length_variance = np.var(sentence_lengths)
# Higher variance = more human-like (natural variation)
# Lower variance = more AI-like (consistent structure)
```

### 2. Perplexity Analysis üßÆ
**What it does:** Measures how "surprised" a language model is by the text, indicating predictability.

**Concept:**
- **Higher Perplexity** = Human-written (more unpredictable, natural variation)
- **Lower Perplexity** = AI-generated (more predictable, consistent patterns)

**Implementation:**
```python
# Calculate word frequency and probability
word_freq = Counter(words)
total_words = len(words)

# Calculate perplexity score
log_prob = sum(math.log(word_freq[word] / total_words + 1e-10) for word in words)
perplexity = math.exp(-log_prob / total_words)
```

### 3. Machine Learning Classification ü§ñ
**What it does:** Uses trained models to classify content based on learned patterns.

**Training Process:**
1. **Synthetic Data Generation** - Creates human and AI text samples
2. **Feature Engineering** - TF-IDF vectorization of text
3. **Model Training** - Random Forest classifier with 100 estimators
4. **Model Persistence** - Saves trained models for reuse

**Training Data:**
- **Human-like patterns:** Informal language, natural variations, personal experiences
- **AI-like patterns:** Formal structure, consistent vocabulary, academic tone

### 4. Combined Analysis üéØ
**What it does:** Integrates all three methods using weighted combination for maximum accuracy.

**Weighting System:**
- Stylometric Analysis: 30%
- Perplexity Analysis: 30%
- ML Classification: 40%

**Benefits:**
- Reduces false positives and negatives
- Handles sophisticated AI-generated text
- Provides balanced, reliable results
