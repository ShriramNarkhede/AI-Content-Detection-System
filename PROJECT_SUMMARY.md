## 🎯 Detection Methods Explained

### 1. Stylometric Analysis 📈
Analyzes writing style characteristics:
- **Vocabulary Richness** - Measures word diversity
- **Sentence Length Distribution** - Analyzes structure patterns
- **Word Frequency Analysis** - Identifies repetitive patterns
- **Punctuation Usage** - Examines punctuation patterns
- **Capitalization Patterns** - Analyzes capitalization frequency
- **Word Length Variance** - Measures variation in word lengths

### 2. Perplexity Analysis 🧮
Measures text complexity:
- **Higher Perplexity** = Human-written (more unpredictable)
- **Lower Perplexity** = AI-generated (more predictable)
- **Statistical Modeling** - Uses probability distributions

### 3. Machine Learning Classification 🤖
Uses trained models:
- **TF-IDF Vectorization** - Converts text to numerical features
- **Random Forest Classifier** - Ensemble learning for robust predictions
- **Synthetic Training Data** - Generated human and AI text samples
- **Probability Scoring** - Provides confidence levels

### 4. Combined Analysis 🎯
Integrates all methods:
- **Weighted Combination** - Balances different analysis methods
- **Cross-Validation** - Reduces false positives and negatives
- **Robust Detection** - Handles sophisticated AI-generated text
